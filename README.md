## Hi! It's nice to meet you!👋

My Name is Chase. 

I'm currently pursuing my bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Brigham Young University Idaho. I'm from Missouri, I transferred from Ozarks Technical Community College, and my first programming languages that I started with are C# and Java (and hence those two are my favorite).

I'm an active developer, software engineer, web developer, and technical problem solver. My skill set is flexible when it comes to computing and machine information.

I'm always looking for opportunites to improve and chances to work wtih others.

Thanks for dropping by!
